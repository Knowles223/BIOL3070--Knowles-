# ABSTRACT

There are many fears around getting WNV and how it is transmitted. This
study is aiming to look at what types of bird species that are more
likely to act as amplifying hosts for WNV and whether or not these
species have a larger population in the areas where WNV is most
prevalent. It is hypothesized that House Finches will act as amplifying
hosts for WNV and that areas with a higher number of WNV will also have
a larger population of House Finches. Data for this experiment was
collected by collecting mosquitoes from various spots around the Salt
Lake City area. These samples were then tested to determine the blood
meal host and also whether it was positive or negative for WNV. The host
species was determined by coding the the COi DNA sequences. Based upon
the results of the study it is proven that the areas with higher number
of WNV cases also has a larger number of House Finches being used as
blood meals for the mosquitoes. The statistical analyses run also show
support for these results.

# BACKGROUND

This data was collected from traps located at various locations
throughout Salt Lake City. Some of these samples that were collected
included some traces and strains of West Nile Virus. The mosquitoes were
collected and then ran through the process of PCR to determine where
they got their blood meal from. Each mosquito was smashed and ran
through PCR. PCR is a way to amplify small amounts of DNA so it can be
BLASTn to determine what kind of organism the DNA belongs to. The
sequence that was amplified was the COi gene. This gene is found in most
organisms and is used to identify organisms. The DNA that was amplified
was then ran through BLASTn to determine what types of species were fed
on by the various mosquitoes in the various locations across SLC
(Viremia data citation). It was found in other studies that house
finches may act as a amplifying host for WNV and that the competetnce of
the house finch was very high in relation to 67 different bird species
that were also studied. (Taieb et al., 2020) In the bar plot made in
class (found below) it was visually detectable that House Finches and
Great Horned Owls tend to have Viremia for the most amount of days.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Question

During this study we were hoping to discover what types of birds are
more likely to conduct the WNV in the Salt Lake City area?

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that based on data collected that the house finch will be
the main host for the WNV from samples collected within the Salt Lake
City area.

## Prediction

If if our hypothesis is true then we will predict that the areas with
the highest count of WNV will be in areas that also have the highest
number of house finches.

# METHODS

1.  Samples of mosquitoes were collected from the traps set at various
    locations across the Salt Lake City area.
2.  The mosquito samples were then sent to our class where we ran PCR to
    amplify the DNA strands that had the COi gene to determine where the
    mosquito’s blood meal came from.
3.  These are the steps of the PCR ran in class and in the lab

- The first step I observed in the demo involved placing the master mix
  into the vials to be run through the PCR process. We also have
  positive and negative samples. The positive sample contains DNA with a
  known sequence, allowing us to compare it with the other samples we
  run. The negative sample is typically just water and contains no DNA,
  allowing us to ensure there were no contaminants. The next step was
  adding the DNA samples to the master mix.
- The next couple of steps are run in a lab, which we weren’t able to
  see in class. These steps include denaturation, which occurs when the
  DNA is separated into single strands. Annealing, which is when the
  primers are inserted, this targets the specific sequence. Extension,
  where the polymerase adds new nucleotides to the target strands,
  creating new strands of DNA.
- The reagents used are template DNA, which is the sample inserted that
  we aim to replicate. Primers are used to mark where the copying should
  start. The following reagent would be loose nucleotides, which is what
  allow the new strands to be made. Some enzymes are also used to help
  build the new DNA strands.

4.  After the PCR was successfully ran it was put into A’s, T’s, C’s and
    G’s. These sequences for each sample was then ran in BLASTn. The
    types of organisms that the blood meals came from were inserted into
    the datasheet.
5.  The final step was analyzing the data to determine if the house
    finch acted as the main host for WNV in the Salt Lake City area.
6.  Once the data was collected it was inserted into a data sheet and
    analyzed using a bar plot (for visual analysis) then also inserted
    into a statistical test to determine if the observations we observed
    in the bar plot were statistically significant.

## 1st Analysis - Barplot

In the first analysis was run to compare the number of mosquito blood
meals that came from locations without any WNV-positive pools and the
locations that had one or more WNV-positive pools for each host species
that was tested.

``` r
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)
```

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere

## 2nd Analysis - Generalized Linear Model

This test allows us to formally determine if the visibly seen
relationship in the bar plots is statistically significant or not. This
test looked at whether or not the number of House Finch blood meals
correlates to the sites with WNV with binary values or just overall WNV
positivity rates with numeric values.

``` r
#glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)

# DISCUSSION

## Interpretation of 1st Analysis (Barplot)

The bar plot that was created from the data collected shows us a visual
representation of the data. The column on the left shows the species
that the blood meals were collected from that tested negative for WNV.
The columns on the right show the blood meal results of the host species
that tested positive for WNV. Based on the bar plot created from the
data collect from the mosquito blood meals, we can see that there is a
strong visual correlation between the number of WNV cases and the
locations with the highest number of House Finches. In both the positive
and negative columns we see a high percentage of the blood meals were
taken from House Finches and an even higher percentage of these tests
came back positive for WNV. This visual representation of the data helps
to support the hypothesis that House Finches act as amplifying hosts for
the WNV and that the areas with the highest number of House Finches will
have the highest number of WNV positive cases. A limitation of this bar
plot is that it doesn’t give you a map of the locations to see exactly
where these cases of WNV occur and where the House Finches have the
highest population size.

## Interpretation of 2nd Analysis (Generalized Linear Model)

The first statistical analysis run gives us the relationship of the
tests taken with House Finch hosts and the ratio of positive tests for
WNV. Given that the p-value is 0.0287 then this is a very significant
relationship. The second statistical analysis run gives us the
relationship of the overall positivity rate with the data collected from
House Finches. The p-value for this test was 4.54e-05 which indicates a
very high correlation. These two statistical analyses support what was
seen the bar plot and what was predicted in the hypothesis. The overall
rate of WNV is higher in areas with a higher number of House Finches.

# CONCLUSION

Based on all the evidence collected and the statistical analyses run it
is possible to confirm the hypothesis stated. There is a correlation
between the host being a House Finch and the rate of positivity of WNV.
There is also a correlation between locations with higher numbers of WNV
and the same locations having higher numbers of House Finches. These are
all supported by the visual representations and the statistical analyses
run. All of these tests and visuals seem to support the idea that House
Finches act as amplification hosts for the WNV in the Salt Lake City
area.
